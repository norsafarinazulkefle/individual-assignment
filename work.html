<P>Three jobs i'm have try before this.</P>
<p>My first job is when i waited for my SPM result. I'm worked as worker at boutique.</p>
<p>After that, i;m quited from there because i need to continued my study</p>
<p>Then, while waiting for my STPM result i'm also has been working at ECO Shop as a Cashier</p>
<p>But after 3 months, i'm quited from there because i want go to my Aunty house at Selayang</p>
<p>Because too long stay at my aunty house, i'll try to find a job at there. So i got the job at 7Eleven near my aunty house</p>
<p>And, after 2 months, i've got the UPU result. So, i'm quited again from 7Eleven and decided go back at my hometown.</p>
<p>what i want to say is, i've learned how to make money by myself without burden my parents. So this experience teached me how to be independent.</p>
